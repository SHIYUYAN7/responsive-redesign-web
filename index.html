                        <div>Visual Hierarchy Issues: Text blocks have dense fonts and lack spacing, reducing readability. Menu items blend into backgrounds, needing more contrast.</div>

                        <div>Layout and Navigation Challenges: Images and text lack proper spacing, cluttering the site. The homepage uses block layout, but the navigation bar scrolls away, reducing accessibility.</div>
                        <br>
                        <div>Grouping and Accessibility Concerns: The navigation menu is unclear and cramped, with some redundant information. Content areas are unorganized, merely stacked.</div>
